## [Unreleased]

### Added
- added basic support to proxy binary requests that are not HTTP

### Changed
- reduced time range of CA certificates to increase likelihood they will be accepted by strict systems (i.e. VMWare vCenter Server)
- improved error message when exception loading or reading certificates or keys (i.e. file not found)
- certificate and private key are saved to directoryToSaveDynamicSSLCertificate when preventCertificateDynamicUpdate is enabled
- returns created expectations from /mockserver/expectation so that it is possible to view the id for new (or updated) expectations
- added ability to inherit @MockServerSettings for Junit5 tests
- switched to distroless container base for security and size

### Fixed

## [5.10.0] - 2020-03-24

### Added
- closure / object callbacks uses local method invocation (instead of Web Socket) when both the client in same JVM (i.e. ClientAndServer, JUnit Rule, etc)
- support to specify a fixed TLS X509 Certificate and Private Key for inbound TLS connections (HTTPS or SOCKS)
- ability to prioritise expectations such that the matching happens according to the specified priority (highest first) then creation order
- ability to create or update (if id matches) expectations from the client using upsert method
- ability to return chunked responses where each chunk is a specific size by using response connection options
- support for XmlUnit placeholders https://github.com/xmlunit/user-guide/wiki/Placeholders
- added ability to control (via configuration) whether matches fail fast or show all mismatching fields
- configuration to disable automatically attempted proxying of request that don't match an expectation and look like they should be proxied

### Changed
- improved X509 certificates by adding Subject Key Identifier and Authority Key Identifier
- stopped delay being applied twice on response actions (#721)
- improve support for clients making initial SOCKS or HTTP CONNECT requests over TLS
- replaced JSONAssert with JsonUnit to improve JSON matching and remove problematic transitive dependencies
- added more detail of cause of match failure

### Fixed
- fixed null point for expectation initialiser with file watcher in working directory specified with relative path
- fixed error resulting in enum not found exception for log events
- fixed error with parsing of json arrays for expectation responses with json body as json object not escaped string
- fixed meaning of disableSystemOut property so that only system out is disabled not all logging
- fixed key store type in key store factory to avoid issue with the JVM changing the defaults

## [5.9.0] - 2020-02-01

- ability to update existing expectation by id
- hot re-loading of expectation initialiser file

- added support to delay socket closure using connection options
- added support to control trusted certificate authorities (trust store) for proxied & forwarded requests
- added support for two-way TLS (mTLS), also called client authentication
- now sends TLS X509 certificate from proxy (i.e. support forward client authentication / mTLS)
- added ability to dynamically create local unique Certificate Authority (CA) X.509 and Private Key to improve securiy of clients trusting the CA

### Changed
- performance improvements for header and cookie handling
- improved JSON validation errors by adding link to OpenAPI Specification
- removed duplicate packages between modules to prepare for java modules
- caught Jackson configuration exception to improve resilience with other Jackson versions in classpath
- moved Junit4 to separate module to reduce size of jar-with-dependencies, simplify code and increase build speed
- enabled case insensitive matching for regex matches
- improved documentation (i.e. on website)
- switched from Bouncy Castle to JDK for certificate and private key generation

### Fixed
- fixed error where ClientAndServer does fully wait for client to stop
- fixed ability to specific a log level of OFF
- fixed bug with keystore type configuration not being used in all places
- added file locking and jvm locking for expectation persistence file to avoid file corruption
- fixed verification incorrectly matching verifier non-empty bodies against empty request bodies
- stopped response callbacks for proxied requests blocking threads
- fixed bug that caused JSON bodies in specified expectations as raw JSON to ignore empty arrays and empty strings

### Security
- updated tomcat (used in integration tests) to version without vulnerabilities

## [5.8.1] - 2019-12-23

### Added
- changelog
- added configuration for all CORS headers
- added support for forward proxy authentication (via configuration)
- added support for overriding forward responses by class or closure
- requests sent to MockServerClient can be updated / enhanced i.e. to support proxies
- dynamic creation of a unique (i.e. local) Certificate Authority X509 Certificate and Private Key instead of using the fixed Certificate Authority X509 Certificate and Private Key in the git repo.
- configuration to require mTLS (also called client authentication or two-way TLS) for all TLS connections / HTTPS requests to MockServer
- configuration of trust store and client X.509 used during forwarded and proxied requests to endpoints requiring mTLS
