## [Unreleased]

### Added
- added stopAsync method to ClientAndServer to allow stop without waiting

### Changed
- performance improvements for header and cookie handling

### Fixed

- fixed ability to specific a log level of OFF

## [5.8.1] - 2019-12-23

### Added
- changelog
- added configuration for all CORS headers
- added support for forward proxy authentication (via configuration)
- added support for overriding forward responses by class or closure
- requests sent to MockServerClient can be updated / enhanced i.e. to support proxies
- added TLS documentation

### Changed
- reduced default number of fail handles used by nio event loop
- improved performance and scalability of logging ring buffer
- improved performance of json serialisation
- deprecated isRunning and replaced with hasStopped and hasStarted to make behaviour more explicit and faster
- improved, simplified and unified handling of Content-Type for bodies
- remove closure callback clients and connections for expectation that no longer exist
- ensure WebSockets for closure callback auto re-connect for unreliable networks
- simplified XML and JSON of bodies in the log and UI
- improved logging for CORS
- added support for TLS with closure / WebSocket callbacks
- simplified handling of TLS and HTTP CONNECT (which is always TLS)
- improved JSON format for expectation to support objects instead of escaped strings

### Fixed
- fixed reading logLevel from system property or environment variable
- ensure all errors are printed to console
- removed TLSv1.3 to avoid any issues with JVM version that do not support TLSv1.3
- handle proxying requests without Content-Length header

### Security
- updated jetty (used in code examples) to version without vulnerabilities

## [5.8.0] - 2019-12-01

### Added
- added support for configuration via environment variables
- added support for overriding responses which an forward overridden request
- added persistence of expectations to file (as json)

### Changed
- ensured all Netty threads are marked as daemon to ensure MockServer does not prevent / delay JVM shutdown
- improved docker-compose example
- improved helm document & example to show how to provide configuration file or expectation initialiser
- improved performance and throttled load for UI

### Fixed
- WARN and ERROR is logged even if logLevel not yet initialised
- ensured exceptions thrown in Main method are always logged
- separated control plane and data plane matching to avoid reverse regex matches and other similar strange behaviour
- fixed handling of multiple parameters in Content-Type header
- autodetect WS or WSS for UI update WebSocket depending on HTTP or HTTPS
- stopped usage being printed multiple time under certain error scenarios

### Removed
- removed re-entrant WebSocket prevention by creating WebSocket client per expectation to improve resilience

## [5.7.2] - 2019-11-16

### Added
- added setting to control maximum size of event log

### Changed
- performance enhancements
- improved matcher failure log messages to output detail at DEBUG level
- made log level configuration more resilient
- allowed exceptions to be thrown from all types of callback methods

### Fixed
- fixed duplicate logging or request when optimistic proxying
- added missing exception on bind error
- ensured client event bus is not static so it not shared across multiple client instances except were server port is identical

## [5.7.1] - 2019-11-09

### Added
- added disruptor ring buffer in front of log to improve performance
- added configuration to ensure MockServer certificate is not updated once created

### Changed
- improved performance with request matcher fast failure
- refactored CPU or memory hot spots
- switched logging to simpler more resilient approach without external dependencies

### Fixed
- fixed log levels to support disabling the log completely without impacting verifications
- ensured clear, reset and verify guarantee all pending log events are completed
- ensured all thread pools (i.e. added disruptor, etc) are stopped with stopping MockServer or Servlets
- respond with not found response (instead of hanging) when failure during template rendering

## [5.7.0] - 2019-11-01

### Added
- added support for retrieving requests and associated responses from log
- added support for access-control-request-headers with CORS

### Changed
- updated to Java 8
- made Jackson more relaxed when parsing JSON already validated by JSON Schema
- improved resilience of request and response parsing, such as when Content-Type is blank string
- improved proxy loop prevention to only break loops within a single instance of MockServer
- increased length of TLS keys to RSA 2048
- increased default request log size and maximum number of expectation

### Fixed
- added global thread-safety to javascript templates for local variables defined without keyword var

## [5.6.1] - 2019-07-21

### Changed
- delayed creation of Nashorn JS engine

### Fixed

- added configuration for certificate authority private key and x509
- added support for large HTTP headers

### Changed
- simplified the certificate generation
- configured logback file appender programmatically

### Fixed
- ensure port binding exception are thrown and MockServer stops if port already allocated
- fixed log configuration to ensure no class loading exception thrown
- fixed control plane matching of expectations with notted entries
