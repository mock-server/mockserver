# Fail closed when a NEW "false-green" test-shape is introduced — a test or
# CI step that reports success while verifying nothing.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# The 2026-07-21 coverage audit classified its findings by the *shape* of the
# false green — the recognisable pattern of a test or gate that passes having
# proven nothing. Those categories lived only in plan documents, so nothing
# stopped them recurring; the repository then produced roughly a dozen fresh
# instances in a single day. This guard turns the highest-value,
# mechanically-checkable shapes into a standing control.
#
# It is deliberately NARROW. A noisy grep everyone learns to ignore is worse than
# nothing, so it enforces only patterns that can be pinned down precisely and that
# each caused a real, shipped false green. The heuristic categories from the audit
# (self-derived golden fixtures; a guard whose own precondition can silently fail)
# are NOT enforced here — they have no low-false-positive textual signature. See
# docs/operations/false-green-guards.md for the full rationale, the declined rules,
# and how to add an allow-list entry.
#
# RULES ENFORCED
#
#   Rule 1 — Docker-gated suite with no fail-closed CI assertion.
#     Every JUnit suite gated by
#       Assume.assumeTrue(DockerAvailability.isAvailable(...))
#     reports SKIPPED (Maven exits 0) when Docker is unusable, so a CI step that
#     only checks Maven's exit code goes green having tested nothing. AGENTS.md
#     already mandates pairing each such suite with assert-suite-ran.sh over its
#     surefire/failsafe reports. This asserts every Docker-gated suite's class is
#     named by some assert-suite-ran glob FOR THE SUITE'S OWN MAVEN MODULE — the
#     match is module-scoped, not class-name-only, so a gated suite in an unpaired
#     module cannot be reported covered merely because its class-name suffix is
#     shared by a glob belonging to a different module. It also asserts no glob is
#     left dangling (naming a suite that no longer exists).
#
#   Rule 2 — a step that mounts the Docker socket then deselects Docker tests.
#     A CI step that grants the Docker socket (run-in-docker.sh -s/--docker-socket)
#     but then runs the suite with the Docker-marked tests deselected (e.g.
#     `pytest -m "not docker"`) starts no container and passes green. This is the
#     exact defect that shipped for the python client. The contradiction — pay to
#     mount the socket, then skip everything that needs it — is the signal.
#
#   Rule 3 — a deferred-work skip that reads as green.
#     A container-integration skip helper (logTestSkip) invoked with deferral
#     language ("CI wiring is a follow-up", TODO, pending, ...) parks work that
#     was never done while the job stays green. The WAR case skipped this way for
#     months. This flags skips whose message defers work rather than declaring a
#     case genuinely N/A.
#
#   Rule 4 — a helm/k3d harness run that can silently revert to skipping.
#     The image-dependent k3d cases (helm_sidecar_injection, helm_clustered_
#     convergence, helm_jgroups_dns_ping) only fail closed on a missing image when
#     the step that runs the harness exports BOTH REQUIRE_CLUSTERED_IMAGE=true and
#     REQUIRE_WEBHOOK_IMAGE=true; delete those exports and CI silently records a
#     SKIP — green, testing nothing. This asserts every step that runs the harness
#     with helm tests active (invokes integration_tests.sh and does NOT set
#     SKIP_HELM_TESTS=true) exports both flags. Keyed on that BEHAVIOUR, not on the
#     filename helm-integration-test.sh, so a rename or a second helm-running step
#     is covered automatically and the docker-only harness step (which sets
#     SKIP_HELM_TESTS=true) is correctly exempt.
#
#   Rule 5 — a JVM-global logging side effect in mockserver-core's parallel phase.
#     LogManager.getLogManager().readConfiguration(...) performs a JVM-global
#     reset() that strips every handler from every logger; LogManager is not
#     classloader-isolated. A mockserver-core test that reaches that reset — by
#     forcing a fresh <clinit> of MockServerLogger/ConfigurationProperties via an
#     isolated classloader, or by calling the static logging setters — races the
#     log capture of any concurrently-running test, silently zeroing a capture (a
#     failing test) or falsely passing a silence assertion (a false green). Such a
#     class MUST be in the sequential-includes list in mockserver-core/pom.xml.
#     ParallelStaticStateGuardTest cannot catch this: it only checks classes
#     EXCLUDED from the parallel phase, and these are in neither list. This asserts
#     every core test source matching a (rare) global-logging signature is
#     sequential. See the signature list below for what it deliberately does NOT
#     catch (static-import call sites; other modules).
#
#   Rule 6 — the Dependabot auto-merge workflow's acceptance paths must stay
#     narrow. .github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml merges Dependabot PRs
#     with NO human in the loop; five load-bearing properties keep majors and
#     version bumps out, and each is easy to "tidy away" in a later edit. This
#     parses the acceptance regexes out of the workflow and asserts:
#     (6a) DIGEST_BRANCH_REGEX stays anchored (^…$), confined to dependabot/
#     docker/, keeps the literal /distroless/ segment, and ends in a hex-run
#     floor of >=7 — the /distroless/ scope is load-bearing, not cosmetic:
#     without it a date-tagged bump ("bump ubuntu from 202401151200 to 202402201200",
#     whose date tokens are all hex) satisfies the title regex and would merge as
#     a VERSION change, the scope being the only thing that rejects it; (6b)
#     DIGEST_TITLE_REGEX requires a >=7 hex run on BOTH the from and to sides;
#     (6c) path B still cross-checks the title as a conjunct of the branch shape,
#     failing closed on mismatch (the two-signal AND cannot collapse to the
#     branch alone); (6d) every group name in .github/dependabot.yml that path
#     A's GROUP_BRANCH_REGEX accepts declares update-types ⊆ {minor,patch}, so a
#     major can never ride a branch literally named *-minor-and-patch; (6e) path C
#     (Dependabot SECURITY updates) keeps its EXPLICIT semver major-exclusion —
#     VERSION_PAIR_REGEX still requires DOTTED-NUMERIC (non-hex) from/to versions,
#     and the path-C block still compares the major components and fails closed on
#     a mismatch (plus the 0.x-minor special case). Grouping cannot supply this
#     bound (GitHub ignores update-types for security groups), so if the major
#     conjunct is deleted or the regex drifts, a major security bump would silently
#     auto-merge. Fails closed if the workflow is missing, a regex cannot be
#     extracted, path B or path C cannot be located, or no group is accepted by
#     path A (an empty sweep is the specific shape this file exists to catch). NO
#     allow-list by design — none of these five has a legitimate exemption (a group
#     in a branch named minor-and-patch must never carry a major; a security PR must
#     never auto-merge across a major), so every violation is a real regression, not
#     a case to wave through.
#
#   Rule 7 — a pipe into an early-exit grep in a pipefail shell script.
#     Under pipefail, `writer | grep -q` fails when grep exits on its first match
#     while the writer still has output (SIGPIPE): a false RED in `if !`, a false
#     GREEN in `if`. Scope: tracked *.sh that set pipefail, all of .buildkite/ and
#     scripts/, and GitHub workflows/actions. The detector is self-tested against
#     check-false-green-guards.rule7-fixture on every run.
#
# ALLOW-LISTS
#
# Some Docker-gated files are legitimately NOT assert-suite-ran-paired (the probe's
# own unit test). Each allow-list entry is verified to STILL be the thing it claims
# (mirroring check-certificate-expiry.sh's expired-fixture assertion): an entry that
# names something that no longer exists, or that is no longer exempt for the reason
# claimed, FAILS the build so the allow-list can never quietly mask a regression.
#
# Requires: git, grep, sed, awk. Runs directly on the agent (no Docker). Bash 3.2 safe.

#   S4  Class.forName(<expr>, true, <loader>)          — a fresh <clinit> forced via
#       an isolated classloader, which re-runs MockServerLogger's static reset
#       (ClassInitializationDeadlockTest, ConfigurationPropertiesInitializationTest)
#
# DELIBERATELY REJECTED as too noisy (would be muted by allow-list churn):
#   * bare `disableSystemOut(`/`disableLogging(`/`logLevel(` WITHOUT the
#     `ConfigurationProperties.` qualifier — these match the per-instance
#     `Configuration` builder (`configuration().logLevel(Level.INFO)
#     .disableSystemOut(false)`), which is NOT a global side effect; requiring the
#     static qualifier drops GrpcFailSafeLoggingTest, ConfigurationSerializerTest,
#     ConfigurationDTOTest and MockServerLoggerTest, all legitimately parallel.
#   * `Class.forName(` in any form — the 1-arg `Class.forName(className)` (already-
#     loaded classes) and `Class.forName('java.lang.Runtime')` inside a template
#     string are legitimately parallel; only the 3-arg initialize=true form forces
#     a fresh <clinit>.
#
# LIMITS (stated rather than implied — this rule does NOT catch):
#   * a call site reached via a static import (bare `logLevel("X")`) or reflection
#     — indistinguishable from the per-instance builder without semantic analysis,
#     so the qualified form is the low-false-positive choice;
#   * a global logging side effect in a module OTHER than mockserver-core — only
#     core has the parallel/sequential surefire split this rule keys on;
#   * S4 keys on the reflective SHAPE, not the loaded class name (one true call
#     site loads a variable), so a 3-arg initialize=true load of a non-logging
#     class would be flagged too — but forcing a fresh <clinit> in a chosen loader
#     is itself parallel-unsafe, and there are zero such cases today.

  # DOTTED-NUMERIC (not hex, not wildcard) version on BOTH the from and to sides,
  # so it can never drift into matching a digest sha or arbitrary text; and (3)
  # EACH comparison — the major `!=` and the 0.x-minor `!=` — is present AND carries
  # a live `return 1` inside THAT comparison's own `if … fi` (bound to that specific
  # `if`, not merely somewhere in path C: C1's npairs `return 1` must not be able to
  # cover a gutted major/minor refuse). Drop any of these and a major (or a breaking
  # 0.x-minor) security bump would silently auto-merge.
  #
  # LIMITS. Like every rule here this is a TEXTUAL tripwire: it checks that each
  # refuse is PRESENT and BOUND to its own comparison, not that it is REACHABLE or
  # that the branch polarity is right. An `if false; then … return 1; fi` wrapper, or
  # a swap of the refuse into an `else` arm, still reads as green. Both are
  # conspicuous control-flow rewrites rather than the quiet deletion / "tidy-away"
  # shape this rule exists to catch, and are left to diff review.
