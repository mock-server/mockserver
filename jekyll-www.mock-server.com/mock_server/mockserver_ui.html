<p>MockServer has a UI that can be used to view the internal state within MockServer, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="#ui_logs_section">logs</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a href="#ui_active_expectations_section">active expectations</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a href="#ui_requests_received_section">requests received</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a href="#ui_proxied_requests_section">proxied requests</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Launch UI</h2>

<h3>Browser</h3>

<p>The UI can be opened in any browser using the URL</p>
<span class="ui_link"><strong>http(s)://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/mockserver/dashboard</strong></span>

<p>For example if MockServer is running on <strong>localhost</strong> on port <strong>1080</strong> use <strong>http://localhost:1080/mockserver/dashboard</strong></p>

<h3>MockServerClient or ClientAndServer</h3>

<p>The UI can be opened by using the <span class="keyword">openUI()</span> function on the <span class="this_value">MockServerClient</span> or <span class="this_value">ClientAndServer</span>.</p>

<p>The UI is launched using the default browser which the JVM determines from the operating system.</p>

<p>The <span class="keyword">openUI()</span> method pauses for 1 second after launching the browser to allow the UI to launch and start collecting logs, this ensures that the log are visible in the UI even if MockServer is shutdown quickly by a test shutdown function, such as After, AfterClass, AfterAll, etc. The pause period can be configured using the method <span class="keyword">openUI(TimeUnit timeUnit, long pause)</span>.</p>

<p>To simplify debugging request matching when multiple instances of MockServer are created if the <a href="/mock_server/debugging_issues.html#logging-levels">logLevel</a> is set to <span class="string_literal">DEBUG</span> and the <strong><a href="/mock_server/configuration_properties.html#button_configuration_launch_ui__debug">launchUIForLogLevelDebug</a></strong> configuration property is enabled (default: false) the <span class="this_value">ClientAndServer</span> constructor or static factor methods will launch the UI so that it is possible to see all logs events for every instance of MockServer.</p>

<a id="ui_logs_section" class="anchor" href="#ui_logs_section">&nbsp;</a>

<h2>Logs</h2>

<p>The logs section list all the logs events recorded by MockServer, including errors, request matching, exception creation, deletion, etc, as shown below:</p>

<p>To simplify the process of understand how each request is handled and which expectation have or have not been matched all logs events for a single request are grouped together.</p>

<p>In addition, to simplify the process or understand why a given expectation has or has not been matched a <strong>because</strong> section is shown for any <strong>EXPECTATION_NOT_MATCHED</strong> this can be expanded to show the full details of which properties did or did not match.</p>
<p>If <a href="/mock_server/debugging_issues.html#logging-levels">logLevel</a> is set to <span class="string_literal">DEBUG</span> then a detailed reason will be included as shown in the white text below.</p>

<h2>Active Expectations</h2>

<p>The active expectations section shows all active expectations in the order they are applied, taking into account all factors such as when the expectation was created, its <strong>priority</strong>, its <strong>timeToLive</strong> and its <strong>times</strong></p>

<h2>Received Requests</h2>

<p>The received request section shows all request received in the order were received.</p>
<p>The list includes request that are matched against an expectation, requests that are proxied and request that are not proxied or matched against any expectation.</p>
