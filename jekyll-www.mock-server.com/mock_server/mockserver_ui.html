<p>MockServer has a UI that can be used to view the internal state and logs within MockServer, including:.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="#ui_logs_section">logs</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a href="#ui_active_expectations_section">active expectations</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a href="#ui_requests_received_section">requests received</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a href="#ui_proxied_requests_section">proxied requests</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The UI can be view by opening the path</p>
<span class="ui_link"><strong>http(s)://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/mockserver/dashboard</strong></span>

<p>For example if MockServer is running on <strong>localhost</strong> on port <strong>1080</strong> use <strong>http://localhost:1080/mockserver/dashboard</strong></p>

<a id="ui_logs_section" class="anchor" href="#ui_logs_section">&nbsp;</a>

<h2>Logs</h2>

<p>The logs section list all the logs events recorded by MockServer, including errors, request matching, exception creation, deletion, etc, as shown below:</p>

<a href="/images/LogMessageUISection.png" target="_blank"><img class="ui_image" src="/images/LogMessageUISection.png" alt="Log Message UI Section"></a>

<p>To simplify the process of understand how each request is handled and which expectation have or have not been matched all logs events for a single request are grouped together.</p>

<p>In addition, to simplify the process or understand why a given expectation has or has not been matched a <strong>because</strong> section is shown for any <strong>EXPECTATION_NOT_MATCHED</strong> this can be expanded to show the full details of which properties did or did not match.</p>
<p>If <a href="/mock_server/debugging_issues.html#logging-levels">logLevel</a> is set to <strong>DEBUG</strong> then a detailed reason will be included as shown in the white text below.</p>
