<p>MockServer is build to support massive scale from a single instance:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#apache_bench">Apache Bench</a> tested <strong>73,307 requests per second with a p99 of less then 1 ms</strong></li>
    <li><a href="#locust">Locust</a> tested <strong>987 requests per second with a p99 of 19 ms</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The test frameworks show different results, this is most likely due to the way TCP connections are re-created in <a href="#locust">Locust</a> but are re-used in <a href="#apache_bench">Apache Bench</a>.</p>

<p>The following frameworks & techniques are used to maximise scalability:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://netty.io">Netty</a> an asynchronous event-driven network application framework to maximise the scalability of HTTP and TLS</li>
    <li><a href="https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor">LMAX Disruptor</a> a high performance inter-thread messaging library to maximise the scalability of recording events (i.e. state) and logging</li>
    <li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html">ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</a> a thread pool that can scheduled delayed tasks is used to execute delay response to avoid blocking threads</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance Tests</h2>

<p>MockServer has been performance tested using <a href="#apache_bench">Apache Bench</a> and <a href="#locust">Locust</a> with the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
    <li>four basic expectations, including method, path and headers</li>
    <li>basic GET request matching third expectation (i.e. three matches are attempted for each request)</li>
</ul>

<p>During the test MockServer was run on a Java 12 JVM, due to the improved GC, with the following command:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash code"><code class="code">java -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:-UseBiasedLocking -Xms8192m -Xmx8192m -Dmockserver.logLevel=ERROR -Dmockserver.disableSystemOut=true -Dmockserver.nioEventLoopThreadCount=500 -jar mockserver-netty-jar-with-dependencies.jar -serverPort 1080</code></pre>

<h3>Apache Bench Performance Test</h3>

<p><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html">Apache Bench</a> showed for a simple test the MockServer can scale up to <strong>73,307 requests per second with a p99 of less then 1 ms</strong>.</p>

<p>The following command was executed:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash code"><code class="code">ab -k -n 10000000 -c 10 http://127.0.0.1:1080/simple</code></pre>

<p>The test results are:</p>
