<h4>Replay Recorded Requests</h4>

<p>Once the recorded requests have been dumped to the log as Java or JSON these can be copied directly into a test setup method.</p>

<p>The request recordings are in Java or JSON for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>request recordings are clear and fully transparent</li>
	<li>request recordings are easily modifiable</li>
	<li>request recordings are code and so can easily be encapsulated in each test setup method, avoiding the anti-pattern of sharing recordings between tests</li>
</ul>
